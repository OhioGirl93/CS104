# HW6
Sliding puzzle board game
- Tests 3 puzzle solving heuristics
- Uses a heap to keep track of tiles

######Instructions for Grader

To compile all files: 

make


This will compile all the files needed to run hw6

To run: ./puzzle (dimension) (initial moves to scramble) (seed #) (heuristic #)

Manual play works. A* is incomplete. 

Only works for 2x2 boards (although prints a repeat of the last step). Infinite loop for bigger boards.
