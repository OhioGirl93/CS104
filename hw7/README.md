To compile all files: 
make
This will compile all the files needed to run hw7

To run rectangles: 
./rectangles (input file) (putput file)

Input file should be formatted correctly as described in the HW assignment, but there are checks if incorrectly formatted.
**INCOMPLETE, rectangles only works when there is no solution.
**however, it does parse successfully.

To run test (my test class for my RBTree and BST Iterator)
./test

In my test class, I added a function print2 which prints out the color of the node as well.
