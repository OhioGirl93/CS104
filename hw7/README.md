# HW7

Binary and Red-Black Trees
- RB Tree inherits from Binary Tree
- Tests search, insert, delete functions of RB Tree

######Instructions for Grader

To compile all files: 

make

This will compile all the files needed to run hw7

To run rectangles: 

./rectangles (input file) (putput file)

Input file should be formatted correctly as described in the HW assignment, but there are checks if incorrectly formatted.

Rectangles only works when there is no solution, however it does parse successfully.

To run test (my test class for my RBTree and BST Iterator)

./test

In my test class, I added a function print2 which prints out the color of the node as well.
